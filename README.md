Because this is a react native app we have added a sample output in the directory : Backend/SoBarApp/src/main/java/sobar/app/service/example


It will generate the output.txt file which will contain the sample information that a user would be displayed.


!IMPORTANT!
This is a gradle project so you must import the project as a "gradle project" in eclipse in order to compile it!

A display of the front-end application can be seen by downloading the "Expo" application on any Andriod Device.
In the Expo application, scan the QR given at: https://expo.io/@willee/sobar

Please email one of us if there are difficulties.
